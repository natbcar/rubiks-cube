## Background
In mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups. The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: a group is a set equipped with a binary operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group axioms are satisfied, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. 

Solving a Rubik's Cube is a well known application of group theory. The Rubikâ€™s Cube group is a group that represents the structure of the Rubik's Cube mechanical puzzle. The Rubik's Cube group is the subgroup of the symmetric group S_48 generated by the six permutations corresponding to the six clockwise cube moves. Each element of this set corresponds to a cube move, which is the effect of any sequence of rotations of the cube's faces.

## Implementation
All of my code is written in python. The cube in my code in represented as a list of length 49. My program takes in a scrambled cube, solves it, and returns the list of moves that were applied to reach the solution. A solved cube is a list in which the ith entry is equal to i. The graphic below provides a visual representation of the cube list. I numbered my cube based on the grahic below
